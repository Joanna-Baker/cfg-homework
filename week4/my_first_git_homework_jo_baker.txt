GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS

- Working directory: this is the directory that you are currently working in and can be seen by the path in the terminal.

- Staging area: The staging area is where files are after being added but before being committed.

- Local Repo (head): A local repository is a git repository that is hosted on the machine locally, rather than on the
                     internet or another network. Head refers to the most recent commit on the currently checked
                     out branch.

- Remote repo (master): A remote repository is a git repository that is not hosted on the machine locally, but is
                        hosted on the internet or another network. Master means the repository currently has master set
                        as the default branch, the default branch is also commonly called 'main'.

WORKING DIRECTORY STATES

- Staged: A staged file is a file that has been added to the staging area, but has not yet been committed. It could be
          a new file or an old file that has be modified.

- Modified: A modified file is a file that has been versioned and then edited; it will be recognised as modified but
            be unstaged until 'git add' is used.

- Committed: A committed file has been stored in (or had its changes stored in) a 'snapshot' in the git index.

GIT COMMANDS

- git add: This stages all the changes in a specified directory or file.

- git commit: This commits all the files in the staging area to a snapshot in the git index. A message can be added
              using git commit -m "<message>".

- git push: This uploads the committed files in the local repository to the remote repository.
            A branch can be specified and is created if it doesn't already exist.

- git fetch: This retrieves (fetches) a specific branch/branches from the repository using git fetch <remote> <branch>.
             All remote references can be retrieved by dropping the branch.

- git merge: This adds the changes from one branch back into another branch e.g. branch_a added back to main.

- git pull: This downloads data from the remote repository (e.g. from github), it is a combination of fetch and merge
            and so it fetches and merges the retrieved data into the local repository.
